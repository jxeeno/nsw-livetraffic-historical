            "html": "<p>Special Event Clearways are strict no-parking zones, and apply even to local residents and businesses with parking permits and Mobility Scheme permit holders. Check signs carefully on the day and the night before, as vehicles left in clearways will be towed and a fee applies. If your vehicle is towed call 132 701 to find its new location. Clearways are in effect on both sides of the road unless specified.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>ROCKS</strong></p><p><strong>From 6:00 am Thursday 26 January to 8am Friday 27 January</strong></p><p>Cumberland St1 Between Longs Lane and Gloucester St (Western side)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BARANGAROO / DAWES POINT / MILLERS POINT </strong></p><p><strong>FROM 3:00AM TO 10:00AM</strong></p><ul><li>Barton Avenue between Hickson Road and Barangaroo Avenue</li><li>Hickson Road 1 between Napoleon Street and Pottinger Street</li><li>Towns Place between Dalgety Road and Hickson Road </li></ul><p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p><p>1 Refers to all on-street parking in this location including along both sides of the kerbside and centre median. </p><p><strong>SYDNEY CBD</strong></p><p><strong>FROM 3:00AM TO 11:00AM</strong></p><ul><li>Clarence Street between Druitt Street and Market Street (Eastern side - Authorised Route Buses Excepted)</li></ul><p><strong>DAWES POINT / SYDNEY CBD / THE ROCKS</strong></p><p><strong>FROM 3:00AM TO 12AM MIDNIGHT</strong></p><ul><li>Argyle Street between George St and Circular Quay W</li><li>Argyle Street between Harrington Street and Cumberland Street (Southern side)</li><li>Circular Quay West from Argyle Street</li><li>Essex St between Harrington Street and George Street (Northern side)</li><li>George St between Alfred Street and Lower Fort Street</li><li>Harrington Street between Argyle Street and Mission Street (Eastern side)</li><li>Harrington Street Between 55 Harrington St and Argyle Street (including parking bay) (Western side)</li><li>Hickson Road 1 between George Street and Pottinger Street</li><li>Pitt Street between Alfred Street and Reiby Place</li></ul><p><strong>Notes</strong>: 1 Refers to all on-street parking in this location including along both sides of the kerbside and centre median and the carpark opposite Pier One.</p><p><strong>SYDNEY CBD </strong></p><p><strong>FROM 9AM UNTIL 5PM</strong></p><ul><li>Macquarie Street between Southern End-Bike Parking and Northern End-Bike Parking No.71 Macq Street (Western side)</li><li>Macquarie Street between Macquarie Street Wilson C/P Entry and Macquarie St Wilson C/P Exit (Eastern side)</li></ul><p><strong>MILSONS POINT</strong></p><p><strong>From 9:30am to 1:00pm</strong></p><ul><li>Olympic Drive between Broughton Street and Alfred Street South</li></ul><p><strong>SYDNEY CBD / THE ROCKS </strong></p><p><strong>FROM 5:00PM TO 10:30PM</strong></p><ul><li>Albert Street between Macquarie Street and Phillip Street</li><li>Alfred Street between Young Street and Phillip Street</li><li>Bent Street between Loftus Street and Phillip Street</li><li>Bligh Street between Bent Street and Hunter Street</li><li>Bridge Street between George Street and Macquarie Street</li><li>Carrington Street 1 between Wynyard Street and Margaret Street (Eastern side)</li><li>Castlereagh Street 1 between Hunter Street and Martin Place</li><li>Circular Quay East 2 from Alfred Street</li><li>Clarence Street 1 between King Street and Margaret Street</li><li>Conservatorium Road between Macquarie Street and Macquarie Street</li><li>Custom House Lane between Loftus Street and Young Street</li><li>Dalley Street between George Street and Pitt Street</li><li>Grosvenor Street between York Street and George Street</li><li>Hunter Street between Pitt Street and Elizabeth Street</li><li>Loftus Lane between Loftus Street and Young Street</li><li>Loftus Street between Bridge Street and Alfred Street</li><li>Macquarie Street between Bridge Street and Sydney Opera House Roundabout</li><li>O&#39;Connell Street 1 between Bent Street and Hunter Street</li><li>Phillip Street between Albert Street and Bridge Street</li><li>Pitt Street between Reiby Place and Bridge Street</li><li>Reiby Place between Loftus Street and Pitt Street</li><li>Underwood Street between Pitt Street and Dalley Street</li><li>York Street 1 between Margaret Street and Erskine Street (western side)</li><li>Young Street between Bridge Street and Alfred Street</li></ul><p><strong>Notes</strong>: 1 Authorised Route Buses Excepted</p><p>2 Includes Motorbike Parking area</p>",
